# WalkerOGL

Testing OpenGL and working on my own rendering engine with GLAD and GLFW. My simple GLSL shaders are: `VertexShader.glsl` and `FragmentShader.glsl`.
Visit my website [slabby.tech](https://slabby.tech) to see my progress with this project.

## Preview
Started with a triangle:

Then I implemented perspective projection to render a cube, and simple camera controls:

Then diffuse & ambient lighting with ASSIMP meshes:

Then I implemented the full phong lighting model:

## TODO
Next I'm going to play around with more lighting techniques, such as shadow mapping.
